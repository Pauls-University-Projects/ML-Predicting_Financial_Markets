## üìå Noteworthy Files

- [`downloadSequencedTrainingData.m`](/Project%20Scripts/downloadSequencedTrainingData.m) - A MATLAB Function Script. Creates a `Dataset` directory with sub-directories for each class. Each class directory will be filled with `.csv` Data Points. The *Comma-Separated Values* files contain stock information for requested shares in a given time window. (*Uses Lenskiy's function for downloading the data from Yahoo Finance*).
- [`createLSTM.m`](/Project%20Scripts/createLSTM.m) - A MATLAB Function Script. Trains a *Long Short-Term Memory* Neural Network model from information stored in the `Dataset` directory.
- [`calculateEarnings.m`](/Project%20Scripts/calculateEarnings.m) - A MATLAB Function Script. Runs a simple simulation with the MATLAB NN model. Currently set up to trade for 3 months.
- [`batchProcess.m`](/Project%20Scripts/batchProcess.m) - A MATLAB Script. Runs the above 3 functions with varying parameters, enabling mass testing with a "hands-off" approach.
